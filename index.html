      <h2>Visualization #1</h2>
      <p>
        This dataset shows, for apartment buildings in Austin, TX, which of them
        have a Chatbot of some sort on their website. If they do have a chatbot,
        it shows what company creates this chatbot. Our group member Will built
        a web scraper to ascertain this data by crawling apartments.com pages
        for a personal product (ie. Will is the original data source), and the
        data structure seemed perfect for a bar graph, so we chose to use it. A
        bar chart makes sense because we want to show the spread of popularity
        of different products among a population. The easiest way to do so is to
        show how many buildings use each type of Chatbot, which can be most
        easily digested in bar-graph format as seen below. We coded
        functionality to show tooltips on hover for each bar (as you can see the
        opacity changes & is given an outline), but there is an error preventing
        them from working. We will ask how to address this issue in class.

      <h2>Visualization #2</h2>
      <p>
        This dataset shows, for a selected sub-population, what correlation
        exists between age and body-mass-index. This dataset is
        <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance/version/1">
          Insurance CSV Data</a
        >
        and is ideal for a scatterplot because each 'row' of information has
        multiple ordinal numerican values (age & bmi). When placing each on an
        axis, we can see any natural correlations between age and bmi very
        easily with the scatterplot format. For this visualization, we could not
        figure out how to limit the amount of 'ticks' on the independent access,
        so that all of the ages were not so squished together. We will ask about
        this in class.
